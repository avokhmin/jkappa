Jerome,

Sorry about that!  That was due to a bug in my code.  Tomorrow we can  
re-run the contact map parser to get the real results.

Here is the correct kappa file, for the future (I also believe this  
one has the correct "%init:" syntax with each protein on its own  
line...let me know if that is not correct)!

Eric
