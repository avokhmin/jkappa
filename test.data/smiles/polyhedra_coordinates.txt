  Polyhedra Coordinates

Here are the 62 (x, y, z) coordinates for the 120 Polyhedron.

Recall that the 120 Polyhedron's vertices are also the vertices for:

    * 10 Tetrahedra
    * 5 Cubes
    * 5 Octahedra
    * 5 rhombic Dodecahedra
    * 1 Icosahedron
    * 1 regular Dodecahedron
    * 1 rhombic Triacontahedron
    * many jitterbugs 

and, of course, the 120 Polyhedron itself.

These coordinates are given in terms of the Golden Mean (a.k.a. Golden
Ratio) which is here symbolized by the letter "p".

"p^2" and "p^3" are the 2nd and 3rd powers of the Golden Mean.

Also below, I give the vertex, edge and face maps for each of the
polyhedra mentioned above.

With this information, it is easy to program a computer (CAD system) to
display, manipulate and obtain numeric information about these polyhedra.
