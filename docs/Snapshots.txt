Takes a snapshot of the current solution at specified time interval. A snapshot is a list of the form
S_1,n_1
...
S_k,n_k

where S_i is a species and n_i is the number of times species S_i can be found in the solution.
Simplx is returning the snapshot in the simplx.xml if you use the option --set-snapshot-time (you can use it multiple times)
